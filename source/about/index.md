Over the past few months, I've learned a lot about javascript reverse engineering. I find this niche incredibly fascinating, and I want to share some of the knowledge I've gained with the world. These articles are aimed at beginner to intermediate level reverse engineers. As such, I'll try to explain my thought process in detail, but not too much detail that it becomes overwhelming.

I'd like to give a special thanks to **[Veritas](https://github.com/char/) @[nullpt.rs](https://nullpt.rs)**, **[Nero](https://github.com/nerodesu017) @ [0x31.sh](https://web.archive.org/web/20211123170243/https://0x31.sh/)** , and **[TellMeMore](https://github.com/pinyugi) @ [botting.rocks](https://feedly.com/i/subscription/feed%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fbotting.rocks%2Frss%2F)** for inspiring me to learn and write about ast-based deobfuscation. 

It is my hope that these articles will inspire others to further explore the field of reverse engineering too. But at the very least, I hope that all of my readers can gain some valuable knowledge. Thanks for visitng, and happy reversing!
